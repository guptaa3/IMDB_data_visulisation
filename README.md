# IMDB_data_visualisation
Data visualisation of IMDB data set 

Aishwarya_Gupta_18210298_CA682.pdf consists of a report of the visualisations prepared and the how the data has been cleaned and transformed.

The Jupyter notebook and Python files have the code that has been used to create the visualisations.

Bokeh library does not support interactivity in jupyter notebook, hence the visualisations are better viewed using the python files.
